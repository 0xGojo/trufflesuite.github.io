# Chain Forking and Exploiting The DAO

Since The DAO [was exploited](http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/06/18/analysis-of-the-dao-exploit/), the Ethereum community has swarmed into action. From hardening our most popular language with the [latest Solidity release](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.4.0) to visualizing possible security vulnerabilities with [SolGraph](https://github.com/raineorshine/solgraph), the community has made security its number one focus. There are many ways in which to discover security threats, with most discussed during Devcon 2 in Shanghai. The [ethereumjs-testrpc](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc) authors have focused on one specifically, which we'll discuss here, called dynamic analysis through chain forking.

## What is Dynamic Analysis?

Dynamic Analysis is the process of executing code and data in real-time in hopes to find issues during execution. It's a similar process to [exploratory testing](http://www.satisfice.com/articles/what_is_et.shtml), with the same goals, but perhaps more technical.

Dynamic analysis on the Ethereum blockchain has historically been costly at worst and tedious at best. If you were to perform dynamic analysis on the live Ethereum chain, transactions would cost you hard earned Ether, which might limit the tests you perform. Moving away from the live chain is possible, but it's a tedious process to move the live data over to a separate chain, and you'd have to perform this process multiple times if you end up mucking with the chain state during testing.

## Hello, TestRPC

In early September, [ethereumjs-testrpc](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc) released it's `--fork` feature meant to solve the issues with dynamic analysis on the live chain (or any chain, for that matter). It did so by allowing you to "fork" from the live chain -- i.e., create a new blockchain that starts from the last block on the existing chain -- allowing you to make transactions on the new chain without spending real Ether or changing the existing chain's state. This feature has big implications for many other areas of development, but today we'll talk about how we can use it for dynamic analysis.

## Exploiting The DAO

One great feature of the TestRPC is that its scriptable. Although this tutorial will show you how we exploited it, with the TestRPC's new `--fork` feature all you have to do is download the code and exploit it yourself! You can find the full exploit code as a [Truffle project here](https://github.com/tcoulter/dao-truffle).
